Parameter	Value	Description
Frequency Band	868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (North America), 920 MHz (Asia)	Operating frequency of the LoRa device
Data Rate	SF7 to SF12	Spreading factor used for modulation, affecting range and data rate
Bandwidth	125 kHz, 250 kHz, 500 kHz	Bandwidth of the transmitted signal
Modulation	LoRa	Proprietary modulation scheme for long-range, low-power communication
Maximum Output Power	20 dBm	Maximum power level the device can transmit
Sensitivity	-142 dBm	Minimum signal strength the device can receive
Range	Up to 15 km (urban), up to 50 km (rural)	Maximum distance the device can communicate
Data Rate and Range Trade-off	Higher spreading factor (SF) increases range but decreases data rate, and vice versa	
Duty Cycle	1% (maximum)	Limits the amount of time the device can transmit to conserve battery life
Power Consumption	Low-power mode: ÂµA, Transmit mode: mA	Typical power consumption in different operating modes
