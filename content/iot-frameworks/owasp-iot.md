## OWASP IoT Top 10 2018

### I1 - Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords	
Use of easily bruteforced, publicly available, or unchangeable credentials, including backdoors in firmware or client software that grants unauthorized access to deployed systems.

#### Types of Weak Passwords

1. Common Passwords: These are easily guessable words or phrases, such as "password", "123456", or "qwerty".
2. Personal Information: Using personal information like birthdays, names, or addresses can make passwords more vulnerable to guessing.
3. Short Passwords: Shorter passwords are easier to crack using brute-force attacks.
4. Repetitive Patterns: Using the same sequence of characters repeatedly (e.g., "aaaaaa") weakens a password.
5. Hardcoded Passwords: When passwords are embedded directly into the code or firmware of a device, they can be easily discovered and exploited.

### I2 - Insecure Network Services	
Unneeded or insecure network services running on the device itself, especially those exposed to the internet, that compromise the confidentiality, integrity/authenticity, or availability of information or allow unauthorized remote control.

1. Weak Encryption: Using weak encryption algorithms or protocols can make data vulnerable to interception and decryption.
2. Default Configurations: Many IoT devices come with default network settings that are insecure and should be changed.
3. Lack of Authentication: Devices that do not require authentication or use weak authentication mechanisms can be easily accessed by unauthorized users.
4. Outdated Protocols: Using outdated network protocols can expose devices to known vulnerabilities.
5. Lack of Access Control: Devices that do not have proper access controls can allow unauthorized users to access and control them.

### I3 - Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces	
Insecure web, backend API, cloud, or mobile interfaces in the ecosystem outside of the device that allows compromise of the device or its related components. Common issues include a lack of authentication/authorization, lacking or weak encryption, and a lack of input and output filtering.
### I4 - Lack of Secure Update Mechanism	
Lack of ability to securely update the device. This includes lack of firmware validation on device, lack of secure delivery (un-encrypted in transit), lack of anti-rollback mechanisms, and lack of notifications of security changes due to updates.
### I5 - Use of Insecure or Outdated Components	
Use of deprecated or insecure software components/libraries that could allow the device to be compromised. This includes insecure customization of operating system platforms, and the use of third-party software or hardware components from a compromised supply chain
### I6 - Insufficient Privacy Protection	
Userâ€™s personal information stored on the device or in the ecosystem that is used insecurely, improperly, or without permission.
### I7 - Insecure Data Transfer and Storage	
Lack of encryption or access control of sensitive data anywhere within the ecosystem, including at rest, in transit, or during processing
### I8 - Lack of Device Management	
Lack of security support on devices deployed in production, including asset management, update management, secure decommissioning, systems monitoring, and response capabilities.
### I9 - Insecure Default Settings	
Devices or systems shipped with insecure default settings or lack the ability to make the system more secure by restricting operators from modifying configurations.
### I10 - Lack of Physical Hardening	
Lack of physical hardening measures, allowing potential attackers to gain sensitive information that can help in a future remote attack or take local control of the device.
