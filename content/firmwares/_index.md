## OWASP Firmware Security Testing Methodology

{{< lead >}}
Revolutionize IoT security with advanced firmware extraction techniques. Discover hidden threats and strengthen your network's defenses.
{{< /lead >}}


### 1 Information gathering and reconnaissance	
Acquire all relative technical and documentation details pertaining to the target device’s firmware
### 2 Obtaining firmware	
Attain firmware using one or more of the proposed methods listed
### 3 Analyzing firmware	
Examine the target firmware’s characteristics
### 4 Extracting the filesystem	
Carve filesystem contents from the target firmware
### 5 Analyzing filesystem contents	
Statically analyze extracted filesystem configuration files and binaries for vulnerabilities
### 6 Emulating firmware	
Emulate firmware files and components
### 7 Dynamic analysis	
Perform dynamic security testing against firmware and application interfaces
### 8 Runtime analysis	
Analyze compiled binaries during device runtime
### 9 Binary Exploitation	
Exploit identified vulnerabilities discovered in previous stages to attain root and/or code execution

1. FACT Extractor - Detects container format automatically and executes the corresponding extraction tool.
2. Firmware Mod Kit - Extraction tools for several container formats.
3. The SRecord package - Collection of tools for manipulating EPROM files (can convert lots of binary formats).
